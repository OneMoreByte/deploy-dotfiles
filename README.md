# deploy-dotfiles
*an easy way to get my dotfiles installed on new Linux machines*

**To install dotfiles and dependencies run the following commands:**

  `$ git clone https://github.com/holmanbph/deploy-vim.git`
  
  `$ cd deploy-vim && bash install.sh`



**Others can use this script as needed.  It is simple to make this valid for your own uses.**

a.  Fork this project to make your own version of this repo

b.  Simply replace my dotfiles in this directory with your own

c.  Add any dependency installations commands to the file **install_dependencies.sh**

d.  Save these changes to your own repo 

1. `$ git add *` 

2. `$ git commit -m "my update"`
  
3. `$ git push`

e.  Now your changes are stored on Github!

f.  Clone from your own repo every time you need to install your vim config
